This project can be added to a solution that will need buttons with up/down images.
Once the project has been added to the solution and the project built two buttons
will appear in the IDE toolbox when a form canvas is open, add one of each of these
buttons to the form, they appear exactly like the ones in MoveDataRow_UpDown project.
